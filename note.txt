Catergory: Azure
Sub-Category: AZ-104

for each IP, there are Network and Host part
- number of network is determined by Subnet mask:
	-> from left to right of subnet, if digit = 1 then network, after that is host
	-> IP address:      172.16.1.0    (10101100.00010000.00000001.00000000)
	-> Subnet mark:     255.255.224.0 (11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000)
	-> from above case: <mark>first 19 digit = network, last 13 digits = host</mark>

- purpose for separate them:
	-> easy management
	-> route can quickly search the specific IP
